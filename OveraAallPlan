# Assembly-and-Neuralink-

 # Making a non invasive neuralink. Eyelide Screen.      


Is to figure out the main components of Neuralink hardware. 
WIth the porpuse of making the whole device smaller.
 SO substraction of size
 and substraction of invasiveness.
So I will keep peeling the layers of abstarction 
from JavaSciprt to C language, and from to assmbly and Binary code. 

By doing this I expect to gain the tools necessary to creat a new smaller and non- invasive technology.

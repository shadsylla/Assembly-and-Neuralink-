# Assembly-and-Neuralink-

 # Making a non invasive neuralink. Eyelide Screen.      


Is to figure out the main components of Neuralink hardware. 
WIth the porpuse of making the whole device smaller.
 SO substraction of size
 and substraction of invasiveness.
So I will keep peeling the layers of abstarction 
from JavaSciprt to C language, and from to assmbly and Binary code. 

By doing this I expect to gain the tools necessary to creat a new smaller and non- invasive technology. 



So for a CPU
'we have:
1- Arithmitic logic unit

2-Program memory

3- RAM random access memory

A function is called OP coode, and each argument called an operand.

intructions take:  4 intruction
firt will be MOV
  source to destination


If I want to compare I will use the instruction CMP


I am going for the most challenging project until now, with  no pay guraranteed and the lack of skills to do it. 
But I am confident That something impactful will arise from this work. Because Anything Worth doing is worth doing poorly. 
Anything worth doing, is worth doing poorly. And adding a third layer to our cortex and limbic systems is definetly worth doing.
